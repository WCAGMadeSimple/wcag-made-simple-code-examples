# WCAG Made Simple – Code Examples

Accessible front-end code snippets, demos, and patterns that align with [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) and practical accessibility best practices.

These examples are companion resources to the [WCAG Made Simple blog](https://wcagmadesimple.com), where posts are paired with tutorials, explanations, and PDF cheat sheets.

## 📖 What You’ll Find Here

- **Semantic HTML examples** – landmarks, headings, tables, forms, lists, etc.
- **ARIA patterns** – when and how to use them responsibly
- **Accessible components** – buttons, modals, navigation, skip links
- **Common pitfalls** – examples of inaccessible code + corrected versions
- **Demo projects** – small pages or apps showing WCAG-compliant markup in action

Each example is tied to a specific blog post, so you can explore *why* something works, not just copy-paste the code.

## 🗂 Repository Structure

Examples are grouped by blog article. Folder names match the article slugs, e.g.:

- /how-semantic-html-landmarks-improve-accessibility/

Inside each folder, you’ll typically find:

- HTML file(s) – the core example
- `README.md` – notes and context
- Optional CSS/JS if needed

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repo and open any example in your browser:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wcag-made-simple-code-examples.git
cd wcag-made-simple-code-examples
```
No build tools required—these are intentionally kept vanilla for clarity.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have improvements to existing examples, please feel free to open an issue or PR.

Please make sure code PRs:
- are accessible first
- have been manually / screen reader tested
- commits are small and focused
- commits follow the [coventional commit guidelines](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- update the relevant README description
- maintain the MIT license

In the future we may expand to include new examples not directly tied to blog articles. However for simplicity at this time, please keep all PRs focused on improvements to existing examples.

## 🌍 Why This Repo Exists

Accessibility can feel overwhelming when buried in W3C documentation.

This repo — and the blog it supports — aims to make WCAG simple, clear, and practical so that developers can build inclusive websites without guesswork.

## ⚖️ Accessibility Compliance Support

This repository is designed to help developers, designers, and organizations create websites that meet accessibility standards required by law.

While the examples follow [WCAG 2.2 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/), they also provide practical guidance for compliance with key accessibility laws and regulations, including:


- **ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)** – United States
- **Section 508 (Rehabilitation Act)** – United States
- **CDA (Canadian Disability Act)** – Canada
- **AODA (Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act)** – Ontario, Canada
- **IASR (Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation)** – Ontario, Canada
- Other national or international laws and regulations that reference WCAG standards

By using these examples, contributors and organizations can build websites that are **inclusive, usable, and more likely to meet legal accessibility obligations**.

⚠️ **Note**: This repository is intended as an educational and practical resource. It does **not constitute legal advice nor do examples guarantee compliance**. Organizations should consult legal professionals for formal compliance verification.
